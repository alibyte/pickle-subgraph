# ðŸ¥’ Subgraph

Subgraph tracking for all PICKLE jars.

## Contributing

`subgraph.yaml` is generated from `subgraph.j2` to account for an ever changing jar set.
Do not edit this file directly, rather update the jinja template.
Pickle jars are tracked in `jars.json`.

## Implemented

- Jar Balances
- Staking Balances

## TODO

- User Balances
